      - Better control on media type, response handles returned media type with `content.{mediatype}`. It replaces `produces` definition on `Operation Object` or top level.
      - Enhanced hypermedia design with `links`.
      - Headers are easier to define because they can be defined in `components.headers` and used in `headers`

The key is a media type or [media type range](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#appendix-D) and the value describes it.  For responses that match multiple keys, only the most specific key is applicable. e.g. text/plain overrides text/*
