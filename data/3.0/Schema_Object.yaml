Schema Object:
  description: |
    The Schema Object allows the definition of input and output data types. These types can be objects, but also primitives and arrays. This object is an extended subset of the [JSON Schema Specification Wright Draft 00](http://json-schema.org/).

    For more information about the properties, see [JSON Schema Core](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-00) and [JSON Schema Validation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wright-json-schema-validation-00). Unless stated otherwise, the property definitions follow the JSON Schema.

    Alternatively, any time a Schema Object can be used, a [Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#referenceObject) can be used in its place. This allows referencing definitions instead of defining them inline.

    Additional properties defined by the JSON Schema specification that are not mentioned here are strictly unsupported.

    details: |
      - Enhanced consistency and easier design with extensive use of Schema Object for all definitions (parameters, bodies, responses, headers)
      - [Inheritance and polymorphism](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#schemaComposition) mecanism has been enhanced (`oneOf`, `anyOf` and `not` have been added) and clarified (see new `discriminator` behaviour).
      - Creating read/write models is easier with `readOnly` (behaviour modified) and `writeOnly` (new).
      - Enhance versioning thanks to `deprecated`.
