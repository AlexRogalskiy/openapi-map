        The value of this keyword MUST be an array. This array SHOULD have at least one element. Elements in the array SHOULD be unique.

        An instance validates successfully against this keyword if its value is equal to one of the elements in this keyword's array value.

        Elements in the array might be of any value, including null.

      originMod: true
      description: |
        The default value represents what would be assumed by the consumer of the input as the value of the schema if one is not provided. Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to the defined type for the Schema Object defined at the same level. For example, if type is string, then default can be "foo" but cannot be 1.

        See [Data Type Formats](#dataTypeFormat) for further details. While relying on JSON Schema's defined formats, the OAS offers a few additional predefined formats.

        The formats defined by the OAS are:

        Common Name | [`type`](#dataTypes) | [`format`](#dataTypeFormat) | Comments
        ----------- | ------ | -------- | --------
        integer | `integer` | `int32` | signed 32 bits
        long | `integer` | `int64` | signed 64 bits
        float | `number` | `float` | |
        double | `number` | `double` | |
        string | `string` | | |
        byte | `string` | `byte` | base64 encoded characters
        binary | `string` | `binary` | any sequence of octets
        boolean | `boolean` | | |
        date | `string` | `date` | As defined by `full-date` - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14)
        dateTime | `string` | `date-time` | As defined by `date-time` - [RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14)
        password | `string` | `password` | A hint to UIs to obscure input.
