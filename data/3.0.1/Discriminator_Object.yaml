Discriminator Object:
  description: |
    When request bodies or response payloads may be one of a number of different schemas, a `discriminator` object can be used to aid in serialization, deserialization, and validation.  The discriminator is a specific object in a schema which is used to inform the consumer of the specification of an alternative schema based on the value associated with it.

    When using the discriminator, _inline_ schemas will not be considered.

    The discriminator attribute is legal only when using one of the composite keywords `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`.

    See [Discrimitor Object](#discriminatorObject) for complete examples.

        An object to hold mappings between payload values and schema names or references. 

        In scenarios where the value of the discriminator field does not match the schema name or implicit mapping is not possible, an optional `mapping` definition MAY be used.
