      - Enhance resource point of view by adding `summary` and `description` on path level.
      - HTTP methode `trace` has been added (TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic information. See [RFC7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.8).)
      - The `servers` property enhance documentation and test possibilities (also available on top and operation levels).

        A list of parameters that are applicable for all the operations described under this path. These parameters can be overridden at the operation level, but cannot be removed there. The list MUST NOT include duplicated parameters. A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a [name](#parameterName) and [location](#parameterIn). The list can use the [Reference Object](#referenceObject) to link to parameters that are defined at the [OpenAPI Object's components/parameters](#componentsParameters).
