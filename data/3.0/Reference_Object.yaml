Reference Object:
  name: $ref
  type: string
  description: |
    A simple object to allow referencing other definitions in the specification. It can be used to reference parameters and responses that are defined at the top level for reuse.

    The Reference Object is a JSON Reference that uses a JSON Pointer as its value. For this specification, only canonical dereferencing is supported.

    A simple object to allow referencing other components in the specification, internally and externally.

    The Reference Object is defined by [JSON Reference](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pbryan-zyp-json-ref-03) and follows the same structure, behavior and rules. 

    For this specification, reference resolution is accomplished as defined by the JSON Reference specification and not by the JSON Schema specification.

    This object cannot be extended with additional properties and any properties added SHALL be ignored.
