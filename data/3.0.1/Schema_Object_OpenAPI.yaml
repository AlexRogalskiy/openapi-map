      name: readOnly
      type: boolean
      changelog:
        isModified: true
        details: Light behavior modification concerning a required property (see description and also the new property `writeOnly`)
      description: |
        Relevant only for Schema `"properties"` definitions. Declares the property as "read only". This means that it MAY be sent as part of a response but SHOULD NOT be sent as part of the request. If the property is marked as `readOnly` being `true` and is in the `required` list, the `required` will take effect on the response only. A property MUST NOT be marked as both `readOnly` and `writeOnly` being `true`. Default value is `false`.
