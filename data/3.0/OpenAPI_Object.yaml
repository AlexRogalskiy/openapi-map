      The new OpenAPI Specification version 3.0 offers many welcomed improvements and new features (see OpenAPI [blog post series about this](https://www.openapis.org/news/blogs/2016/10/tdc-structural-improvements-explaining-30-spec-part-2)).
      
      Here are the noticeable changes on top level (*navigate through the tree to see what happened on other levels*): 
      - Bye bye `swagger` and hello `openapi`.
      - Reusable definitions are centralized in `components` making the document more consistent (the previous version mixed reusable and global definitions on the same level).

        This string MUST be the [semantic version number](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) of the [OpenAPI Specification version](#versions) that the OpenAPI document uses. The `openapi` field SHOULD be used by tooling specifications and clients to interpret the OpenAPI document. This is *not* related to the API [`info.version`](#infoVersion) string.
